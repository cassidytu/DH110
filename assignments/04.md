## Assignment 04: UX Storytelling

# Climate Action

Cassidy Tu | DH110 Fall '22

## Purpose
UX storytelling through multiple components (such as personas, empathy maps, scenarios, and journey maps) are used in this project to further understand users by humanizing them. I am able to myself into the perspective of the users by considering all these facets of these personas that are representative of the targeted audience. The purpose is to provide insight about the user and their story, pain points, and behavior, ultimately leading to a better focus on their needs/goals.

## Scenario + Journey Map

### Scenario 01: Sabrina Chen
#### Why Sabrina is Using the Product
> Sabrina is a mother of 2 and currently is a 4th grade middle school teacher at Ramona Elementary School, where she is preparing to create a lesson path about climate action for Earth Week. She knows that climate change is a complex and overwhelming issue, so she wants to break down the issue into concepts that are easy to understand for her class. All of the resources that she has looked at for information are not that engaging and consist of long blocks of text. She thinks that her students will quickly lose interest in them if she presents them this way. However, for her to teach the class, she must also understand the complexities of climate change and it is very time consuming and tedious to go through multiple different articles. Sabrina also wants to find opportunities for her and her kids, inside and outside the classroom, to get involved with climate action in the community. She thinks that taking a part in combating climate change will set a good example to her students that they can change the world. Thus, Sabrina wants a way to engage and encourage her students to understand climate change and take action against it for a better future.

#### How Sabrina is Using the Product
> After class, Sabrina turns on her work laptop to open the website as she begins to find ideas for her lesson plan for Earth Week. When she first opens the landing page of the website, there are multiple different climate action plans designated to a specific mission of combating climate change. There is a description of the mission under each title and a button to “take action”. She clicks on the button and it leads her to another page that goes more in depth about the action plan. The page has resources about how to help save the ocean, including petitions, tips, and guides. One of the sections of the page is dedicated to a volunteer program to help clean up the nearby beach, where she clicks on it to read more about the program. This leads to an event planner for the beach clean up, where she registers both her and her students to participate in. Feeling excited and satisfied, Sabrina plans the upcoming school day around the field trip.

### Scenario 02: Chris Allen
#### Why Chris is Using the Product
> Chris is a newly graduated college student who moved back into his family’s house, with his mom, dad, and younger sister. He hasn’t kept in touch with his sister as much as he wanted but wants to get more involved with her life. She is a huge advocate for climate action and has a big interest in environmental sciences. Chris wants to educate himself about climate change and how he can get involved with climate action, so he can talk to her about it and have a shared interest with his younger sister. However, Chris doesn’t know where to start with the issue and thinks that it is very overwhelming. He skims through articles talking about the impact of climate change on the environment and feels further discouraged. He looks at resources to get involved but doesn’t understand how he can make a difference as a single individual. Not only does he think that his actions are useless to combat climate change, but he also can’t see how some organizations are taking steps to do the same. He is suspicious by the lack of transparency and visual/physical effects of their efforts, ultimately refusing to donate to these organizations and taking action to combat climate change. Thus, Chris wants a way to be incentivized to take climate action and see the results of his actions. 

#### How Chris is Using the Product
> During his lunch break, Chris uses his personal laptop to open the website to get more information on how he can take some easy actions to combat climate change. He sees the landing page of the website which contains multiple climate action plans for different missions of climate actions. He clicks on the first action plan he sees and is directed to another page that goes into more detail about the mission the plan is trying to accomplish. The page contains various resources ranging from petitions, guides, tips, and programs to help save water around your house. The first resource is a tutorial on how to install a showerhead that will help save water and reduce the amount of water wasted, ultimately saving money and water. This peaks Chris’ interest and he clicks on it. The company sponsoring this will send a free showerhead, so Chris creates an account on the website and enters his address for it to be shipped to. Once he completes the tutorial, his account on the website will track his impact progress and show him how much of a change is doing with the changes he is implementing in his daily life. Feeling motivated and ambitious, Chris texts his younger sister about the package that is coming to their house and asks her how else he can help combat climate change.
