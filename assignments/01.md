## Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation

Cassidy Tu, DH110 Fall '22

### Project Description

### Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

The following principles are general rules of thumb to improve interaction design:
| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | Users should always be informed about what is going on and should be given appropriate feedback to their actions |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | Use concepts and language that are familiar and logical to the user |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | Allow users to make mistakes; give them options to undo and redo tasks |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | Follow conventions and make sure design is consistent across the platform |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Get rid of error-prone conditions and provide users with safety nets for high-cost errors |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Minimize user's memory load by giving them suggestions and help in context |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Provide multiple ways to perform a task to make the platform accessible to all users |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Provide only relevant content and features |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | Tell users what the problem is and provide suggestions to fix it |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | Supply users with extra help to complete their tasks |


### Nielsen Norman Group's [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems

The following rating scale can be used to evaluate the severity of usability issues:
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

## Website 01: [NOAA Climate.gov](https://www.climate.gov/)

### About
Climate.gov project is a collaboration of multiple NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) offices, who are responsible for being the nation's environmental intelligence agency. The website serves to provide timely and authoritative scientific data and information about climate science, in turn, promoting public understanding of climate-related events and supplying them with tools and resources to make eco-conscious decisions.

The website is filled with a numerous amount of content to meet the needs of different audiences, which can be both accomodating but overwhelming. Each tab at the navigation bar drops down to a multitude of choices and ultimately acts like its own website, rather than parts of a singular cohesive site. My goal would be to simplify these different branches into a more coordinated website, while still maintaining the wealth of information provided.

### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* While the user's current location is displayed, the presentation could be further emphasized. The current display has the specific tab and subpage written in a small text on a gray bar underneath the navigation bar, which could easily be overlooked by users who focus on the main navigation bar more.

  <img src="../images/nav-bar.PNG" alt="nav bar current location" width = "300px"/>
</p>

> Severity Rating: 1 

> *Recommendation: Display the user location directly on the navigation bar.*
