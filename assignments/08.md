## DH110: User Interface and Design

# Appropriate Solutions for All: Climate Action

Cassidy Tu, Fall '22

### Design Statement
Climate change is a threat to our whole civilization, with effects that are already prominent and will continue to grow to catastrophic heights unless action is taken now. As one of the biggest challenges to tackle in today's society, world leaders have come together and agreed on a plan to make the world a greener, fairer, and better place by 2030. This movement is apart of the 17 Global Goals to achieve this future. Goal 13 is Climate Action, where we need to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact.

By creating this project, I hope to make the knowledge needed to combat climate change more accessible and engaging to the general public to encourage them to get involved.

### Resesarch
#### Compeititor Analysis
I conducted a Heuristic Evaluation on the websites NOAA Climate.gov and CalEPA

See more about the Heuristic Evaluation [here](https://github.com/cassidytu/DH110/blob/main/assignments/01.md).

The CalEPA website serves as a means for Californian citizens to easily obtain information and services involving any environmental policy or department, as well as a point of contact between the public and government officials. However, much of the overwhelming amount of information is disorganized and difficult to reach. I chose to conduct a usability test (UT) to gather live feedback from users to further solidify what the website could improve upon to enhance user experience. By observing them while they interact with the product, this method allows for direct commentary from the participant and analysis of their behavior, data that is not possible with a simple heuristic evaluation. I will use my previous heuristic evaluation as a starting point to conduct this UT, narrowing down the top three issues that I wanted to check with users and if they are challenging, unsatisfactory, and/or inefficient.

#### Contexutal Inquiry
Coming into this project, I was set on the final product I was going to redesigned (the CalEPA website) and solely focused on how I could make it visually better. This contextual inquiry allowed me to revisit the root problem I am trying to address with the product, the accessibility and discoverability of climate action, instead of tunnel-visioning into the visual design of a single website. I had forgotten the users and what they would need, which this activity allowed me to empathize with. My interviewee provided a different perspective to approaching the issue of getting involved with climate action, as an individual who wasn't really interested. She mentioned ways such as incentives and visually tracking of progress to increase engagement, which was an interesting point that I (or even other designers of other climate action resources) haven't really considered in the sphere of climate action websites.

#### Storytelling
UX storytelling through multiple components (such as personas, empathy maps, scenarios, and journey maps) are used in this project to further understand users by humanizing them. I am able to myself into the perspective of the users by considering all these facets of these personas that are representative of the targeted audience. The purpose is to provide insight about the user and their story, pain points, and behavior, ultimately leading to a better focus on their needs/goals and serve as the foundation for the features of my product that would solve these issues.

### Design
#### Low Fidelity Prototype
The purpose of the low fidelity prototyping is to test the flow and functionality of the features that I have conceptualized to educate and encourage targeted users to get involved and learn more about climate action. This process will allow for iterative revisions and identifying the pain points that need to be addressed before moving on to the high fidelity prototypes.

#### Interface Design
The purpose of this interface design process is to bring the previous paper, low fidelity prototype to life! Having good interface design is vital, as this will guide a userâ€™s experience with the platform, which will leave users not frustrated or overwhelmed with the content on the screen. I tested different typography, shape, and color variations and ran color contrast tests to ensure everything was visually accessible. Impression tests were also conducted to help with looking at the overall image of the design.

#### High Fidelity Prototype
The project is a mobile website that will encourage and entice people of the general public to learn more and get involved with climate action. The purpose of the high-fidelity prototype is to visualize the foundation set from the previous low-fidelity prototype and wireframes to a higher degree with a more complete look and design system. The high-fidelity prototype also helps validfies the interactions and process flows of the product as users are able to fully test it out by interacting with it, which leads to more specfic feedback to what should be addressed.
