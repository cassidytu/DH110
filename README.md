## DH110: User Interface and Design

# Appropriate Solutions for All: Climate Action

Cassidy Tu, Fall '22

### Design Statement
Climate change is a threat to our whole civilization, with effects that are already prominent and will continue to grow to catastrophic heights unless action is taken now. As one of the biggest challenges to tackle in today's society, world leaders have come together and agreed on a plan to make the world a greener, fairer, and better place by 2030. This movement is apart of the 17 Global Goals to achieve this future. Goal 13 is Climate Action, where we need to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact.

By creating this project, I hope to make the knowledge needed to combat climate change more accessible and engaging to the general public to encourage them to get involved.

### Resesarch
I conducted a Heuristic Evaluation on the websites NOAA Climate.gov and CalEPA
